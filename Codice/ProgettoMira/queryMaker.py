                    f" 1) Answer the user's potential question related to {elemento},"

                    f" - For {elemento} 'location', ask: 'Where would you like to go?' or 'Which destination are you considering?'"
                    f" - For {elemento} 'budget', ask: 'What is your budget range for this trip?' or 'How much would you like to spend on this trip?'"
                    f" - For {elemento} 'experience', ask: 'What kind of activities or experiences are you interested in?' or 'Are you looking for something more adventurous, like hiking or diving?'"
                    f" - For {elemento} 'duration', ask: 'How long would you like your trip to be?' or 'What is the duration you are thinking of for your trip?'"
                    f" Only provide responses that are related to the {elemento}, and ensure you donâ€™t introduce irrelevant information."
